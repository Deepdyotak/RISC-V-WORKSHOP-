//To get the simulation results use the below command

// To debug a specific part use this 
spike -d pk sum1ton.o
//then u should type till which register u wanna check 
until pc 0 100b0  // this says until Program counter 100bo
//then which reg value
reg 0 a2
// INSTRUCTIONS 
lui - load upper immediate that means it will load the upper values of register bits[31:12] with the values assigned to them
riscv64-unknown-elf-objdump -d sum1ton.o
addi = add immediate 
any 64 bit number is called "doubleword" in riscv lang
32 bit number is word 
2 32 bit = 64 bits number is doubleword
1 bye = 8 bits
64 bits = 8 bytes
8 bits-> byte-> 4 bytes-> word->2 words or 8 bytes-> doubleword
total patterns numbers(unsigned and positive numbers) we can represent using n bits is 0 - 2^(n-1)
total unsigned and positive numbers that can be represented by rv64  system is o to  2^64 -1
